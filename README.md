## About Me

I'm currently pursuing my **B.E. in Computer Engineering** at **Sinhgad Institute of Technology, Lonavla**, and have gained hands-on experience in **full-stack web development** using **JavaScript**, **ReactJS**, **Node.js**, **ExpressJS**, and **MongoDB**.

I have worked on several projects, including a **MERN stack Ed-Tech platform** and a **Weather App**. I also interned as a Data Structures and Algorithms problem solver at **Skolar**, where I enhanced my algorithmic problem-solving skills.

I am constantly learning and looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and collaborate with like-minded professionals.
