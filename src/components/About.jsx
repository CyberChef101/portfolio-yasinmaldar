        Hello! I'm Yasin Maldar, a dedicated Computer Engineering undergraduate with a strong passion for full-stack web development, particularly using the MERN stack. Currently pursuing my B.E. in Computer Engineering at Sinhgad Institute of Technology, I have gained expertise in a range of technologies including JavaScript, ReactJS, Node.js, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and more. My journey in tech has been driven by a deep-rooted passion for solving complex problems and creating intuitive, user-centric solutions.

I have hands-on experience in developing full-stack web applications, including an Ed-Tech platform and a weather app, and have interned as a Data Structures and Algorithms problem solver. I thrive on challenges, continuously learning new concepts to enhance my skills. Whether it's building scalable web applications or diving into competitive programming, I am always excited to explore innovative ways to solve problems and push my limits.

I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals and contribute to exciting projects. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
